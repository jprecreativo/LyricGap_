I've been alone
Waiting at home
I've got not feel the air no more
Sick of love
My heart is sick of love

I even know
If getting worst
I turn off the radio
Sick of love
My ear is sick of love

I cannot find
I'm more than blind
Everything I think is wrong
Sick of love
My mind is sick of love

Who is blamed
With their flame
You can't trust me anymore
Sick of love
We are all sick of love

I'm gonna fly tonight
I'm taking you
Don't be afraid
I am your Superman

I'll bring a box
With sugar
To put you in
Let's dance again
The evil game
I'm gonna fly tonight
I'm taking you
Don't be afraid
I am your Superman

I'll bring a box
With sugar
To put you in
Let's dance again
The evil game

I'm gonna fly

I'm gonna fly

I'm gonna fly

I'm here alone
Waiting at home
I've got not feel the air no more
Sick of love
My heart is sick of love

I even know
If getting worst
I turn off the radio
Sick of love
My ear is sick of love

I cannot find
I'm more than blind
Everything I think is wrong
Sick of love
My mind is sick of love

Who is blamed
With my flame
You can't trust me anymore
Sick of love
We are all sick of love

Just feel the music
Don't feel the pain
We are in a river
We are all inside
It's getting better
It's not a game
You want to live it, you want
You must forget

I'm gonna fly tonight
I'm taking you
Don't be afraid
I am your Superman

I'll bring a box
With sugar
To put you in
Let's dance again
The evil game

I'm gonna fly tonight
I'm taking you
Don't be afraid
I am your Superman

I'll bring a box
With sugar
To put you in
Let's dance again
The evil game

I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna fly
Let's dance
I'm gonna fly
I'm taking you
I'm gonna fly
I'm taking you
I'm gonna fly
I'm taking you
'm gonna fly
I'm taking you

Sick of love!
