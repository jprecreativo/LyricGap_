I heard you crying loud 
all the way across town 
'cause you been searching for that someone 
and it's me out on the prowl 
as you sit around feeling sorry for yourself 

Well, don't get lonely now 
and dry your whining eyes 
i'm just roaming for the moment 
sleazin' my back yard so don't get 
so uptight you been thinking about ditching me 

no time to search the world around 
'cause you know where i'll be found 
when i come around 

Well, i heard it all before 
so don't knock down my door 
i'm a loser and a user so i don't need no accuser 
to try and slag me down because i know you're right 
So go do what you like 
make sure you do it wise 

you may find out that your self-doubt means nothing 
was ever there 
you can't go forcing something if it's just not right 

no time to search the world around 
'cause you know where i'll be found 
when i come around 

no time to search the world around 
'cause you know where i'll be found 
when i come around 

when I come around, when I come around, when I come around
